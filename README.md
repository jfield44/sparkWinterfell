# sparkWinterfell

Winterfell is a simplified sample app for the Spark Android SDK.  It is currently in early development, but the intent is to provide an example that is easier for beginners to follow than the Kitchen Sink sample app.  This is a complete rewrite of my earlier sample app and strives to be a ground up implementation instead of a cutdown Kitchen Sink.  As such, there is still much missing functionality.

## Limitations
* Only JWT auth has been implemented yet
* Auth, and Phone registration must be performed manually in the JWT Activity (hit the buttons)
* No hangup button yet (method implemented)
* Deregistration currently broken
* CallObserver methods stubbed but not implemented yet
